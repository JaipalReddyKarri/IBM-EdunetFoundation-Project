# IBM-EdunetFoundation-Project

## About the Project
A **capstone project** under the **Edunet Foundation initiative**, developed on the **IBM Cloud platform** using **Watsonx.ai Studio’s AutoAI**, to analyze and classify rural infrastructure projects under **PMGSY schemes** (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA) based on physical and financial characteristics. The system automates classification, improving transparency, efficiency, and decision-making for rural road connectivity initiatives in India.

## Problem Statement
Rural connectivity is vital for economic growth and social development in India. The **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)** aims to provide all-weather road connectivity to unconnected habitations.  
However:  
- Manual classification of thousands of projects is **slow and error-prone**.  
- Different schemes have **unique objectives, funding structures, and technical requirements**.  
- There is a need for an **automated, data-driven approach** to improve monitoring, resource allocation, and policy evaluation.

---

## Proposed Solution
A regression-based AI system was developed using **IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI**, leveraging project metrics such as length, cost, and location to predict and classify projects into the correct PMGSY scheme. This solution enables:  
- **Automated project classification** for faster processing.  
- **Improved decision-making** through data-driven insights.  
- **Real-time scheme prediction** via IBM Cloud deployment.
